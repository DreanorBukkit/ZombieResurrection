## Known Bugs
Be careful while setting up the potion strength. If you change the INCREASE_DAMAGE potion effect to a certain value, players get killed instantly without getting a deathscreen. They will be able to walk around without noticing that they are actually dead, unless the try to hit a player or break a block.
